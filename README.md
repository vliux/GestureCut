The application recogonizes the gesture from device screen, and starts the relevant task for you, as a shorcut way!
There are two components which interacts with the user:
- the screen saveer, which is the MainActivity. Users can launch tasks by applying gestures.
- the top-level floating window, uses can both define and apply gestures.
